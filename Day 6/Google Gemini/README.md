Python Solution for Cephalopod Math Puzzles
This repository contains a Python script to solve two related math puzzles based on structured text input.

Language Chosen
Python 3.x

The choice of Python is based on its suitability for structured file I/O and text processing. The grid-like nature of the input, requiring column-wise parsing and arithmetic, is handled cleanly and efficiently using Python's string and list manipulation capabilities.

Prerequisites
Language Version: Python 3.6 or newer.

Runtime: The standard Python runtime environment.

Dependencies
No external libraries or packages are required. The solution uses only the Python standard library.

Build Instructions
No compilation is needed as Python is an interpreted language.

Run Command
The script can be executed directly from the command line using the Python interpreter:

Bash

python solve.py
(Ensure solve.py and input.txt are in the same directory.)
