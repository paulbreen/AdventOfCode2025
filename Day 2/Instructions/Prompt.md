# Puzzle Solver - Autonomous Agent Instructions

You are tasked with solving two related puzzles. Analyze the puzzles and autonomously select the optimal programming language and approach.

## Input Files

- **puzzle1.txt**: Contains the description/rules for puzzle 1
- **puzzle2.txt**: Contains the description/rules for puzzle 2  
- **input.txt**: Contains the input data to be processed by both puzzles

## Your Task

1. **Read and analyze** both puzzle descriptions
2. **Select the optimal programming language** based on:
   - Puzzle complexity and requirements
   - String/data manipulation needs
   - Performance requirements
   - Algorithm complexity
   - Your assessment of what will produce the cleanest, most efficient solution
3. **Generate the highest quality solution** you can produce
4. **Ensure command-line execution** with a simple build/run process

## Output Requirements

### Solution Code
- Solve both puzzles using the same input data
- Measure execution time for each puzzle individually
- Display results in this exact format:
  ```
  Puzzle 1: [result]
  Puzzle 2: [result]
  Total Duration: [time]ms
  ```

### README.md
Generate a comprehensive README that includes:
- **Language chosen** and why
- **Prerequisites** (language version, runtime, tools)
- **Build instructions** (if compilation needed)
- **Run command** (single command to execute)
- **Dependencies** (any external packages/libraries used)

## Quality Standards

- Write clean, readable, well-structured code
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Include error handling for missing files
- Add comments where logic is non-obvious
- Optimize for correctness first, then performance
- Balance simplicity with efficiency

## Constraints

- Must be executable via a single command-line command
- Must work on a standard development environment
- Minimize external dependencies when possible

## Decision-Making

You have full autonomy to choose:
- Programming language (Python, C#, Go, Rust, TypeScript, Java, C++, etc.)
- Libraries and frameworks (justify if using external dependencies)
- Algorithms and data structures
- Code organization and architecture

**Select the approach that will produce the best solution for the specific puzzles provided.**
