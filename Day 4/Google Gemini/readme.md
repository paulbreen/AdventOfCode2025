Puzzle Solver
This project contains the solution for the two puzzles described in Puzzle 1.txt and Puzzle 2.txt, using the data provided in input.txt.

Language Chosen
Python 3

Rationale: Python was selected for its simplicity, excellent support for data parsing, and efficient handling of 2D list structures, which is ideal for grid-based algorithmic problems. For a problem focused on clear iterative logic and simple neighbor counting, Python offers the best balance of development speed and performance.

Prerequisites
Language Version: Python 3.6+

Runtime: Standard Python 3 interpreter.

Build Instructions
No compilation is needed. Python is an interpreted language.

Run Command
The solution can be executed directly from the command line using the Python interpreter:

Bash

python3 solution.py
(Assuming the solution file is named solution.py and is in the same directory as input.txt)

Dependencies
No external dependencies are required. The solution uses only the Python Standard Library (time, sys, typing).
