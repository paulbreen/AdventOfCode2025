# Puzzle Solver – Movie Theater (Day 9)

## Overview
This program solves two related geometry puzzles involving red and green tiles arranged on a grid.  
Both puzzles are solved using the coordinates in `input.txt`.

## Language Choice
**Python 3** was selected because:
- The tasks rely heavily on coordinate geometry and pairwise comparisons.
- Python provides clear, concise implementations for polygon containment.
- Expected runtime is well within acceptable limits even at O(n²).
- Zero external dependencies; simple command-line execution.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or newer.

No additional packages are required.

## Files
- `solver.py` — main solution script  
- `input.txt` — list of red tile coordinates  
- `Puzzle 1` and `Puzzle 2` logic implemented internally

## Build Instructions
No build/compile step needed.
