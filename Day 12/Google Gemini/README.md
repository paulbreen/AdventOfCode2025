Puzzle Solver Solution: Christmas Tree Farm Presents
Language Chosen: Python 🐍
Python was selected for its rapid development speed and code clarity, which are essential for implementing a complex, recursive backtracking algorithm needed to solve the NP-hard packing problem in Puzzle 1. Python's robust handling of string manipulation makes input parsing easy, and its native data structures (lists for grids, sets for shape transformations) are perfect for representing the problem's state.



Prerequisites
Language Runtime: Python 3.8+

Tools: Standard Python interpreter (no external packages are required).

Build Instructions
No build or compilation is required. Python is an interpreted language.

Run Command
The solution is executed directly via the Python interpreter. The input file must be present in the same directory.

Bash

python solve_puzzles.py input.txt
Dependencies
None (Standard Python Library only).
