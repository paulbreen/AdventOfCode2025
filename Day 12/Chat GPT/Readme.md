# Puzzle Solver

## Language Choice

**Python 3** was selected for the following reasons:
- The problem is dominated by parsing and combinatorial logic rather than raw numeric throughput.
- Python enables rapid iteration and clear expression of backtracking / constraint logic.
- No external dependencies are required, ensuring portability and simple execution.

## Prerequisites

- Python **3.9+**
- Standard library only (no third-party packages)

## Files

- `main.py` — command-line solver for Puzzle 1 and Puzzle 2
- `input.txt` — puzzle input (shapes + regions)
- `puzzle1.txt` — description of Puzzle 1
- `puzzle2.txt` — description of Puzzle 2 (required to fully solve)

## Build Instructions

No build step required.

## Run Command

```bash
python3 main.py
