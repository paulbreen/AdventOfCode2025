🐍 Factory Puzzle Solver
This repository contains a Python script to solve two related factory machine puzzles using algebraic methods.

Language Chosen
Python 3.10+ was chosen for its excellent text parsing capabilities and its suitability for implementing the necessary linear algebra algorithms cleanly.

Prerequisites
Language Version: Python 3.10 or later.

Runtime: Standard Python 3 runtime environment.

Dependencies
None. The solution is self-contained using only the Python standard library. The matrix operations are handled with basic list/array manipulation, avoiding external libraries like numpy or scipy for maximum portability and to meet the spirit of a self-contained solution.

Build Instructions
No build step is required as the solution is a single Python script.

Run Command
The script reads input.txt and solves both puzzles in a single execution.

Bash
